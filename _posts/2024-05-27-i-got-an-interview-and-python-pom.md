Okay, so this happened on Friday but I haven't written an update since then: I got an interview! It almost feels unreal because it has been literal months since I last got an interview beyond a recruiter screen, but I am so stoked. I would be the first QA Engineer hired by the company, I would come in and focus heavily on automated testing, and would have a large role in building the team from there.

Admittedly, I am a little bit intimidated, but I have done this type of thing before. I learned so much in my time in a similar role at Flowhub; what to do, what not to do, and how to manage my own expectations for myself and the expectations I have for my team. I feel much more prepared, so full of energy, and ready for a challenge.

In preparation for this interview, and in support of building out my test automation portfolio, I have been scaffolding a project with Python and Selenium using the page object model design pattern. It has been a great refresher on building this type of framework from scratch and doing so in Python.

By the time this post hits my website, I will have merged those changes to the master branch of [that repo](https://github.com/travwritescode/test-portfolio) so you can see the progress there. I will be building this out a lot more as I also continue to work on my ISTQB Test Automation Engineer certification too, using this project as a sort of follow-along for the syllabus.

I am anxious but excited for the interview. I plan to really crush it and I am putting in the effort to prep for it like no other before. Let's build something great!
