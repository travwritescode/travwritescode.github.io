        <h2>What I am doing here</h2>
        <p>
            My goal here is to create a portfolio page for all of my coding work. I am making an interactive
            webpage to showcase my profile and who I am, but also using it as a way to learn web development,
            expand my skillset and knowledge base, and add some test automation practice into a web page I have
            developed myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am doing all of this <em>out in the open</em>. Starting from scratch, I am making this webpage as I learn about HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the things I want to learn in this process:
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript/ES6</li>
                <li>Cypress.io</li>
                <li>Python (web dev packages)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
