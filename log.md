# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML portion of The Odin Project Foundations course including the recipes website project

**Thoughts:** Very easy for me because I am so familiar with HTML due to my career in QA. Nice that TOP doesn't belabor HTML with a bunch of elements I won't really use. Straight and to the point teaching me what I need to know.

### Day 2: February 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first CSS module in The Odin Project Foundations course. Updated the recipes practice site with some basic styling.

**Thoughts:** CSS has always been a little bit challenging for me. Surprisingly, my spatial reasoning is more challenged than I would expect. It is nice getting into more design-oriented material though. I think this is more what I am hoping to get out of this journey: an exercise in my creativity.

### Day 3: February 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: A lot of studying of the flexbox model in CSS. Mostly reading articles and a little bit of practice.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is simple in theory, difficult in practice. But this is what practice is all about, solidfying the theory! The practice was done on the Odin Project practice repo which I am not pushing to GitHub.

**Link to work:** N/A, finished 3 modules in the Odin Project Flexbox section. Doing the practice for the 4th module.

### Day 4: February 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Practice exercises for flexbox in the odin-css-exercises repo. Did all of the exercises except for the last one.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is definitely getting easier, though I feel like I am over-engineering some of my solutions. Some more study and practice on this concept and I think I'll will be doing really well.

### Day 5: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the final exercise for flexbox on the holy grail layout. Got started on the landing page project at the end of the flexbox section.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I have a pretty good handle on CSS and HTML right now. Flexbox is still tough and I need to spend some time reading the resources I have put in my to-dos. The landing page project is going alright but I am definitely deep in something I have a tenuous at best grasp of. Struggling to make all content centered like in the reference image (while extending background colors to the edges of the page). It feels like a mess but I understand that is part of the process.
Maybe if I work any further today it will be on reading and studying materials.
