I found myself doomscrolling LinkedIn today. Isn't that weird? It's kind of like disaster porn except I'm living everyone else's despair about the job market while distracting myself from my own hopelessness.

And that's often what it feels like: hopeless.

I received cold outreach from two recruiters yesterday. I responded to both within a couple of hours. I never heard back from either one. And that's sort of microcosm of my experience in the job market lately. It feels like I am just shouting into the void, hoping someone will hear me but never really getting any response.

So I shouted some more. I put my job application pants on, wrote some cover letters, and fired off some messages to recruiters and hiring managers. Those are the action available to me right now so I continue on in hope of finding something.

I also wrote up a little career story that is serving as a homepage on my website right now. Just a first draft and I will revise it and rewrite it, I'm sure. But it's my story from beginning until now. Oh, and I continued with The Odin Project, learned about CSS Grid.

All in all, it was a good day. I can't control what happens after submitting a job application, all I control is that I submit one.
