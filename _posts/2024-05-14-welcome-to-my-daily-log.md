Hello! If you are reading this, welcome to the blog section of my professional website, and thank you for being here.

I intend for this blog to be a log of everything I work on in any given day. I used to be tracking all of this just through my GitHub contributions, but that doesn't tell much of the story. This is where you will be able to see the nitty gritty of each thing I work on in a given day.

If you are involved in hiring for your software teams, thank you for being here and I hope you find some helpful insight into how I work! If you are a peer in the software industry, I'm glad you're here too and maybe we can work together on some exciting projects. Either way, please feel free to reach out to me through my contact information available on this site.

As for today's work:
- I have gotten this website fixed up and hosted on GitHub's pages! This involved fixing some missing layout pointers
- Read chapter 2 in studying for the ISTQB Test Automation Engineer certification
