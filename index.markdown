# My Career Journey

### 2023 - Laid off from Datapeople üòî

My time as a Linguist at Datapeople unfortunately came to a close at the beginning of January. As the startup tried to navigate the uncertainty that embroiled the software industry at this time, my position was eliminated  unexpectedly.

After being laid off, I took some time to pursue a passion of mine by earning my real estate license in Utah. I spent some time learning the ropes of real estate with a local brokerage. I intend to continue pursuing real estate in my own capacity with everything I learned.

At the end of the summer, just after leaving real estate, I volunteered my skills as a photographer with [First Descents](https://firstdescents.org/) on a wilderness therapy excursion kayaking the Arkansas River in Salida, CO. I captured the transformative power of nature as young adults who have been diagnosed with cancer challenged themselves on white water.

Since returning from the volunteer trip I have:

- Gotten married
- Earned my ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level certification
- Worked at a local ski shop in Salt Lake City

All while keeping [my skills in test automation](https://github.com/travwritescode/test-portfolio) and QA processes sharp and applying for jobs in my spare time.

### 2021 - Hired as a Linguist at Datapeople üéâ

After months of job searching, I accepted a position at [Datapeople](https://datapeople.io/) as a Linguist. I and the other Linguists worked on their SaaS product - [a web-based text editor](https://datapeople.io/language-analytics-for-job-posts/) made for talent acquisition and hiring professionals to write job descriptions that attract a more qualified and diverse candidate pool.

My primary responsibility was to maintain and update the database of natural language rules according to new feature requests and customer feedback. This included manual testing through the UI of the app for new language guidance features.

I also maintained the language team‚Äôs internal tools - a Flask app built to query the database of natural langue rules in Datapeople‚Äôs proprietary encoding format. I built two new features in this tooling using Python and SQL to improve Linguists‚Äô efficiency in testing new rules and guidance.

### 2020 - Feeling burnt out, I Left Flowhub üò™

It was a tough decision to leave. The company had gone through many changes as the needs of cannabis dispensaries changed drastically during the pandemic.

In all honesty, I had a hard time transitioning from in-office work to fully remote. I missed being close to my team and the requirements of my role changed a lot as the needs of our customers changed.

In a turbulent time, I decided it was time to move on and take a couple of weeks off before resuming my search for a new role.

### 2019 - Accepted an exciting role at CannaTech startup [Flowhub](https://flowhub.com/) üå≥

Not actively searching for a new role, I applied to one job, got interviewed, and got offered a position as just the second QA Engineer at the company. I came in with a focus on helping the engineering organization get their test automation efforts off the ground.

I implemented a test coverage reporting tool through their existing Cypress test suite then set about expanding test coverage of Flowhub‚Äôs two main products. 

As startups go, the engineering organization went through some rounds of restructuring which saw me moved to an Agile development team. As a member of this new team, I managed QA work throughout the SDLC as we built the first iteration of Flowhub‚Äôs next generation point-of-sale solution, now released as [Flowhub Maui](https://flowhub.com/product).

### 2018 - Accepted a QA position in Denver with Xactly üèî

I moved to Denver after accepting a job as a QA Engineer at [Xactly](https://www.xactlycorp.com/). Working on a team building Xactly‚Äôs next generation sales incentive tracking software, I managed manual QA testing responsibilities while building E2E and robust regression automated test suites.

While here, I developed a strong philosophy on the balance between manual and automated testing and a sound approach to handling regression testing.

### 2016 - My first position in software as a QA consultant at Magenic üîå

Contrary to what a lot of people may feel, I loved being a consultant and I think this was an ideal first role in the industry. In two years with Magenic I got to work with clients such as Meijer, Polaris, and Staples.

I had a large focus on test automation in these roles, testing APIs built for Meijer‚Äôs store pickup program - technology that most major grocery stores now use. I also tested a mobile app made for Polaris dealers to quickly access vehicle information.

I spent a few months manually testing an indoor GPS navigation app being built for Staples HQ employees to find conference rooms and resource in their Framingham office, technology that is now widely used in malls and big box stores.
