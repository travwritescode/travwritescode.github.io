# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: February 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Another day of reading, this time about loops. Also installed Node.js on my virtual machine.

**Thoughts:** More reading! All refreshers on loops. It is weird how JavaScipt has a for loop but the syntax is different. Anyways, I am not up to the JavaScript exercises portion and raring to go tomorrow.Excited to get through this and on to the next project. 85% of the way through Foundations! Let's go!

**Link to work:** N/A - Installed Node.js and got through most of the loops on the Odin Project.

### Day 10: February 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Problem Solving, Understanding Errors, and Clean Code modules in the JavaScript basics course. Also completed the ROck Paper Scissors project.

**Thoughts:** I can still pick up programming languages rather easily. The Rock Paper Scissors project was quite easy to complete, only requiring about an hour of work. The rest of the modules were interesting today, especially the article on pseudocode. I am excited to continue with Node.js and get deeper into JavaScript!

### Day 9: February 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: More reading about JavaScript functions and a little bit of practice in writing them.

**Thoughts:** Reading, reading, reading. So much reading on functions but they are really funky in JavaScript. With declarations, expressions, and arrow functions, callbacks, the syntax is wild and wacky. I am ready to start practicing after all of this reading though. Bring on the project!

**Link to work:** N/A - finished the Functions module in the JavaScript Basics course on The Odin Project.

### Day 8: February 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Lots of reading about JavaScript basics. Variables, data types, Chrome Devtools, and functions

**Thoughts:** Tough going on a day I am very sleepy. I am kind of building up a bunch of backlog items I am ignoring in the name of progress on the TOP curriculum. I am going to need to take some time to go back and get through all of these backlog items including interactive learning, videos, and articles.

**Link to work:** N/A - made it through 3.5 modules in The Odin Project JavaScript Basics chapter.

### Day 7: February 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on the Odin Project landing page project. Got started on the JavaScript lessons.

**Thoughts:** All done with the landing page project and moving on t JavaScript! I wonder how clean my project solution really is because it feels like it was hacked together. I know it is not very responsive but it definitely looks better than I expected. Excited to be into the thick of it in JavaScript now!

### Day 6: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on landing page project. Added info section, quote section, and call to action section.

**Thoughts:** The concepts and methods used in CSS and Flexbox are still solidifying in my brain. They are very much still tenuous but I do genuinely think I am getting better with them each and every day. The three sections I made today came together very quickly. Once I finish the footer section, all that will be left is to clean up all of the design elements. Definitely looking forward to getting started with JavaScript and seeing where else this journey will take me!

### Day 5: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the final exercise for flexbox on the holy grail layout. Got started on the landing page project at the end of the flexbox section.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I have a pretty good handle on CSS and HTML right now. Flexbox is still tough and I need to spend some time reading the resources I have put in my to-dos. The landing page project is going alright but I am definitely deep in something I have a tenuous at best grasp of. Struggling to make all content centered like in the reference image (while extending background colors to the edges of the page). It feels like a mess but I understand that is part of the process.
Maybe if I work any further today it will be on reading and studying materials.

### Day 4: February 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Practice exercises for flexbox in the odin-css-exercises repo. Did all of the exercises except for the last one.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is definitely getting easier, though I feel like I am over-engineering some of my solutions. Some more study and practice on this concept and I think I'll will be doing really well.

### Day 3: February 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: A lot of studying of the flexbox model in CSS. Mostly reading articles and a little bit of practice.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is simple in theory, difficult in practice. But this is what practice is all about, solidfying the theory! The practice was done on the Odin Project practice repo which I am not pushing to GitHub.

**Link to work:** N/A, finished 3 modules in the Odin Project Flexbox section. Doing the practice for the 4th module.

### Day 2: February 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first CSS module in The Odin Project Foundations course. Updated the recipes practice site with some basic styling.

**Thoughts:** CSS has always been a little bit challenging for me. Surprisingly, my spatial reasoning is more challenged than I would expect. It is nice getting into more design-oriented material though. I think this is more what I am hoping to get out of this journey: an exercise in my creativity.

### Day 1: February 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML portion of The Odin Project Foundations course including the recipes website project

**Thoughts:** Very easy for me because I am so familiar with HTML due to my career in QA. Nice that TOP doesn't belabor HTML with a bunch of elements I won't really use. Straight and to the point teaching me what I need to know.
