# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 20: February 25, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished JavaScript exercises

**Thoughts:** Yikes. The `findTheOldest()` solution took me way too long. I had sort convoluted the logic of a couple of different things and was using the wrong function to check the one of the values existed. After some help from Discord and more trial and error, including debugging in VSCode, I have a working solution!
That was a ton of work but I have done a good job of sticking with it and perservering to arrive at a solution. Excited to start on the final project for the Foundations course and move on to the JavaScript path!

### Day 19: February 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continuing work on JavaScript exercises

**Thoughts:** Worked more on the JavaScript exercises files. I got the `getTheTitles.js` tests solved (though not using JS array methods) but I am really struggling with the `getTheOldest.js`. I can't figure out the `.reduce()` method and how that is supposed to be used for the solution on this one. I think I will need some help from the people in the Discord channel for JS help.

### Day 18: February 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Exercises progress

**Thoughts:** Did JavaScript exercises from the Odin Porject JavaScript Exercises repo. Completed the calculator, palindromes, and fibonacci exercises. My solution for fibonacci was definitely pretty hacky and poorly organized and optimized. My solution for the palindromes exercise was pretty spot on though. A lack of understanding of how regular expressions work made my solution look a bit messy. I will need to revisit those and watch the video I have saved in my to-dos.

### Day 17: February 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Objects module progress.

**Thoughts:** This module is a dense one. This is the first real practice with a lot of callback functions and these array methods we are learning in `filter()`, `map()` and `reduce()` are going to be hugely important for upcoming work. I am definitely going to take my time with the exercises and make sure I have them down and well understood before moving on.
Definitely a little bit distracted today before we fly out in the morning to go to MN. Will need to get my coding in on the plane in the morning.

### Day 16: February 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Etch-A-Sketch project.

**Thoughts:** Etch-A-Sketch was a fun one! It was a little bit tricky in the middle there but I got it all working properly. I could have improved it with the extra credit problems and some better styling, but I think it is a pretty darn good solution!
Excited to wrap up the Fundamentals course and move on to my JavaScript path!

### Day 15: February 21, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Rock Paper Scissors UI portion with winner message display. Started on the etch-a-sketch project.

**Thoughts:** I think I could probably make some improvements to the game flow of the rock paper scissors game. It doesn't need to be the most optimized web page but the way it is set up right now is a little bit inefficient.
I got started on the etch-a-sketch project too. While previously I was intimidated by this one, getting it set up and a basic grid and functionality was a breeze. I suspect I should be able to wrap this one up rather quickly once I sit down to work on it again.

### Day 14: February 20, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finsihed DOM Manipulation Module and started Rock Paper Scissors UI

**Thoughts:** Coding up a basic UI for Rock Paper Scissors game. A little bit tricky getting everything to work together and i need to figure out a way to reset the game loop by resetting the scores once one of them reaches 5.

**Link to work:** Progress in the rock paper scissors repo on the [rps-ui branch](https://github.com/travwritescode/rock-paper-scissors/tree/rps-ui)

### Day 13: February 19, 2024

**Today's Progress**: DOM Manipulation Lesson

**Thoughts:** Low energy day today. I made it most of the way through the module on DOM manipulation with JavaScript. It was a long one with a lot of interactive learning, but the learning is super important so I am taking my time a little bit. Also, just a sort of low-energy day today.

**Link to work:** N/A - DOM manipulation with javaScript module.

---

### Day 12: February 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript Exercises

**Thoughts:** Just practicing JavaScript today by doing the JavaScript exercises in the exercises file from the Odin Project GitHub page. Completed them all in a little over an hour. Will be getting started with the DOM manipulation module today if I can make more time to work on this.

**Link to work:** N/A - JavaScript practice exercises from forked GH repo.

---

### Day 11: February 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Another day of reading, this time about loops. Also installed Node.js on my virtual machine.

**Thoughts:** More reading! All refreshers on loops. It is weird how JavaScipt has a for loop but the syntax is different. Anyways, I am not up to the JavaScript exercises portion and raring to go tomorrow.Excited to get through this and on to the next project. 85% of the way through Foundations! Let's go!

**Link to work:** N/A - Installed Node.js and got through most of the loops on the Odin Project.

---

### Day 10: February 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Problem Solving, Understanding Errors, and Clean Code modules in the JavaScript basics course. Also completed the ROck Paper Scissors project.

**Thoughts:** I can still pick up programming languages rather easily. The Rock Paper Scissors project was quite easy to complete, only requiring about an hour of work. The rest of the modules were interesting today, especially the article on pseudocode. I am excited to continue with Node.js and get deeper into JavaScript!

### Day 9: February 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: More reading about JavaScript functions and a little bit of practice in writing them.

**Thoughts:** Reading, reading, reading. So much reading on functions but they are really funky in JavaScript. With declarations, expressions, and arrow functions, callbacks, the syntax is wild and wacky. I am ready to start practicing after all of this reading though. Bring on the project!

**Link to work:** N/A - finished the Functions module in the JavaScript Basics course on The Odin Project.

---

### Day 8: February 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Lots of reading about JavaScript basics. Variables, data types, Chrome Devtools, and functions

**Thoughts:** Tough going on a day I am very sleepy. I am kind of building up a bunch of backlog items I am ignoring in the name of progress on the TOP curriculum. I am going to need to take some time to go back and get through all of these backlog items including interactive learning, videos, and articles.

**Link to work:** N/A - made it through 3.5 modules in The Odin Project JavaScript Basics chapter.

---

### Day 7: February 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on the Odin Project landing page project. Got started on the JavaScript lessons.

**Thoughts:** All done with the landing page project and moving on t JavaScript! I wonder how clean my project solution really is because it feels like it was hacked together. I know it is not very responsive but it definitely looks better than I expected. Excited to be into the thick of it in JavaScript now!

### Day 6: February 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on landing page project. Added info section, quote section, and call to action section.

**Thoughts:** The concepts and methods used in CSS and Flexbox are still solidifying in my brain. They are very much still tenuous but I do genuinely think I am getting better with them each and every day. The three sections I made today came together very quickly. Once I finish the footer section, all that will be left is to clean up all of the design elements. Definitely looking forward to getting started with JavaScript and seeing where else this journey will take me!

### Day 5: February 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished the final exercise for flexbox on the holy grail layout. Got started on the landing page project at the end of the flexbox section.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I have a pretty good handle on CSS and HTML right now. Flexbox is still tough and I need to spend some time reading the resources I have put in my to-dos. The landing page project is going alright but I am definitely deep in something I have a tenuous at best grasp of. Struggling to make all content centered like in the reference image (while extending background colors to the edges of the page). It feels like a mess but I understand that is part of the process.
Maybe if I work any further today it will be on reading and studying materials.

---

### Day 4: February 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Practice exercises for flexbox in the odin-css-exercises repo. Did all of the exercises except for the last one.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is definitely getting easier, though I feel like I am over-engineering some of my solutions. Some more study and practice on this concept and I think I'll will be doing really well.

**Link to work:** [odin-css-exercises/flex](https://github.com/travwritescode/odin-css-exercises/tree/main/flex)

---

### Day 3: February 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: A lot of studying of the flexbox model in CSS. Mostly reading articles and a little bit of practice.

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is simple in theory, difficult in practice. But this is what practice is all about, solidfying the theory! The practice was done on the Odin Project practice repo which I am not pushing to GitHub.

**Link to work:** N/A, finished 3 modules in the Odin Project Flexbox section. Doing the practice for the 4th module.

---

### Day 2: February 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first CSS module in The Odin Project Foundations course. Updated the recipes practice site with some basic styling.

**Thoughts:** CSS has always been a little bit challenging for me. Surprisingly, my spatial reasoning is more challenged than I would expect. It is nice getting into more design-oriented material though. I think this is more what I am hoping to get out of this journey: an exercise in my creativity.

### Day 1: February 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML portion of The Odin Project Foundations course including the recipes website project

**Thoughts:** Very easy for me because I am so familiar with HTML due to my career in QA. Nice that TOP doesn't belabor HTML with a bunch of elements I won't really use. Straight and to the point teaching me what I need to know.
