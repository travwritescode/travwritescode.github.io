I started the day off with not one, not two, but three job application rejections in my email inbox. Not good.

But such is life on the job hunt and I really cannot let the rejections define my day or week. By definition, more of them will come through than will interview invitations. All I must do is brush myself off and get back to work.

Speaking of work, I have some updates for you:
1. I am resuming my work on the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. I stopped working through it a while ago but I want to become an expert on web technologies so I will keep learning about the nitty gritty of it all. Plus I am really enjoying building websites!
2. This website! This is something I have been sort of peripherally working on for a while and, although it is very much in a work-in-progress state, I am excited for this to become the center of my online professional presence.

I know I haven't updated in almost a week, but that doesn't mean I haven't been working in the background. I will be keeping this log more updated as I continue to work on my personal projects. Here is what I have worked on today:
- Finished building the [sign up form project](https://travwritescode.github.io/sign-up-form/) for The Odin Project curriculum. It is obviously not hooked up to anything but the layout and password checking were a fun challenge.
-  I am currently updating the README file for my [test automation portfolio](https://github.com/travwritescode/test-portfolio) repository to be, well, more helpful. Work in progress on this, especially as I intend to keep adding to this project.
- The site you are on right now! Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. I have the sidebar pretty much built for now, though I want to add some helpful links to it ASAP, including a link to my LinkedIn. I also added navigation and a page for my blog posts to live.

Exciting things will continue rolling out so stay tuned!
